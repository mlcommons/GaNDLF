# This file is used to provide strings that identify individual channels and/or label files.
# The below example uses the filename ending and extension to do this.
# It has two channels of input (t1 and t2) and one label (seg).
# So if hello_t1.nii.gz, hello_t2.nii.gz, and hello_seg.nii.gz exist underneath workspace/data/Subject001/,
# we will detect them as part of the subject Subject001. 
# workspace/data/Subject001/ could contain identically or similarly named files and would be detected separately.
channels: [
    _t1.nii.gz,
    _t2.nii.gz
    ]
label: _seg.nii.gz
