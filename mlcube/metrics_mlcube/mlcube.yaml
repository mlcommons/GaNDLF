## This YAML file contains MLCube configuration.
## The gandlf_deployMetrics tool looks for this file to generate your metrics calculation MLCube image.
## If you are an author, this file (or the derivative generated by gandlf_deployMetrics)
## can be distributed along with your container to enable use as an MLCube.
## See the MLCube specifications (ex: https://mlcommons.github.io/mlcube/runners/) for additional options.
