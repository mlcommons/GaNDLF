# Entrypoint forces all commands given via "docker run" to go through python, CMD forces the default entrypoint script argument to be gandlf_run
# If a user calls "docker run gandlf:[tag] gandlf_anonymize", it will resolve to running "python gandlf_anonymize" instead.
# CMD is inherently overridden by args to "docker run", entrypoint is constant.

# The below force the container commands to run as a nonroot user with UID > 10000.
# This greatly reduces UID collision probability between container and host, helping prevent privilege escalation attacks.
# As a side benefit this also decreases the likelihood that users on a cluster won't be able to access their files.
# See https://github.com/hexops/dockerfile as a best practices guide.
