## pre-processing
# this constructs an order of transformations, which is applied to all images in the data loader
# order: resize --> threshold/clip --> resample --> normalize
# 'threshold': performs intensity thresholding; i.e., if x[i] < min: x[i] = 0; and if x[i] > max: x[i] = 0
# 'clip': performs intensity clipping; i.e., if x[i] < min: x[i] = min; and if x[i] > max: x[i] = max
# 'threshold'/'clip': if either min/max is not defined, it is taken as the minimum/maximum of the image, respectively
# 'normalize': performs z-score normalization: https://torchio.readthedocs.io/transforms/preprocessing.html?highlight=ToCanonical#torchio.transforms.ZNormalization
# 'normalize_nonZero': perform z-score normalize but with mean and std-dev calculated on only non-zero pixels
# 'normalize_nonZero_masked': perform z-score normalize but with mean and std-dev calculated on only non-zero pixels with the stats applied on non-zero pixels
# 'crop_external_zero_planes': crops all non-zero planes from input tensor to reduce image search space
# 'resample: resolution: X,Y,Z': resample the voxel resolution: https://torchio.readthedocs.io/transforms/preprocessing.html?highlight=ToCanonical#torchio.transforms.Resample
# 'resample: resolution: X': resample the voxel resolution in an isotropic manner: https://torchio.readthedocs.io/transforms/preprocessing.html?highlight=ToCanonical#torchio.transforms.Resample
# resize the image(s) and mask (this should be greater than or equal to patch_size); resize is done ONLY when resample is not defined

# options: affine, elastic, downsample, motion, ghosting, bias, blur, gaussianNoise, swap

# all transforms: https://torchio.readthedocs.io/transforms/transforms.html?highlight=transforms
# 'kspace': one of motion, ghosting or spiking is picked (randomly) for augmentation
# 'probability' subkey adds the probability of the particular augmentation getting added during training (this is always 1 for normalize and resampling)

## queue configuration - https://torchio.readthedocs.io/data/patch_training.html?#queue
# this determines the maximum number of patches that can be stored in the queue. Using a large number means that the queue needs to be filled less often, but more CPU memory is needed to store the patches
q_max_length: 40
# this determines the number of patches to extract from each volume. A small number of patches ensures a large variability in the queue, but training will be slower
q_samples_per_volume: 5
# this determines the number subprocesses to use for data loading; '0' means main process is used
q_num_workers: 2 # scale this according to available CPU resources
# used for debugging
q_verbose: False
