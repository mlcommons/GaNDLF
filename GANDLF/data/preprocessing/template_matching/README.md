# GANDLF Preprocessing Template Matching

This module provides a blueprint for preprocessing algorithms that are based on template matching. Specifically, the following normalization techniques are currently available:

- Histogram matching: https://doi.org/10.1109/42.836373
- Global histogram equalization: same as adaptive, but using a linear template image
- Adaptive histogram equalization: https://doi.org/10.1109/83.841534
- Vahadane normalization: https://doi.org/10.1109/tmi.2016.2529665
- Ruifrok normalization: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11531144/
- Macenko normalization: https://doi.org/10.1109/ISBI.2009.5193250
